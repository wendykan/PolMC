<H1>MCObject</H1><hr>
Class that takes care of propagating photons within objects. This is the top class for any object.
<br>
<p></p>
<hr><br>
The class MCObject (for Monte Carlo object) is the base class for all "scattering/turbid" objects: it takes care of most of the complexity
involved in propagating a photon in a scattering medium.  One does not instantiate an MCObject: you instantiate a derived class (MCBox, 
MCInfiniteLayer, etc...).   MCObject moves the photon, decreases its weight, checks to see if it crosses 
interfaces, calculates the probability of Fresnel reflection/transmission by querying the Photon when required, etc... 
It does not assume any particular shape for the object, it does not assume any particular formalism for the scattering interaction, it does
not assume anything about the photon (wavelength, polarization, etc...) and does not assume a particular random number generator or algorithm 
for arbitrary distribution.
<br><br>
A scattering object may contain other scattering objects, which are "placed" inside this object using PlaceIntoObject() and local coordinates
for the object.  Each specific object has its own local origin (look at the documentation, but for MCBox, it is the center of one face).
