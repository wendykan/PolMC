# Object geometry
#
# The object type.  Currently, we support: box, sphere, single layer
# cylinder.

# - If the object is a box, one must define:
# size=(width,height,depth) and Nx,Ny, Nz for the number of bins
# - If the object is a (single) layer, one defines:
# size=(imagingwidth,imgaingheight,thickness) and Nx,Ny for number of bins
# thickness, Nx, Ny and imagingWidth, imagingHeight
# - If the object is an ellipsoid (made of 36 small triangles)
# size=(width,height,depth) and Nx,Ny for the number of bins on each triangle (usually 1 and 1)
# If the object is a cylinder, define
# height,radius, Nr, Nh

# For a box, define the following:

Nx=11

# For a layer, define the following:
#thickness=0.1
#imagingWidth=1
#imagingHeight=1
#Nx=40
#Ny=40

# For a sphere, define the following, which represent the full width axes
# Currently, a sphere is made from 36 triangular elements
# Each element can be subdivided in Nx * Ny elements for statistics
#size=(1,1,1)
#Nx=1
#Ny=1
#Nz=1

# For a cylinder, define the following:
#Nr=10

#
# The "world" is responsible for keeping track of energy deposition
# in a Cartesian grid that span from Vol_XMin to Vol_XMax in the x direction,

# Every axis is binned with Nx(yz) elements.
