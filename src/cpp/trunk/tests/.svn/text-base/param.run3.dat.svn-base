# Object geometry
#
# The object type.  Currently, we support: box and layers
# If the object is a box, one must define:
# xwidth, yheight and zdepth, Nx, Ny and Nz.
# If the object is a (single) layer, one defines:
# thickness, Nx, Ny and imagingWidth, imagingHeight

# Input Stokes vector
# If allStokesVector is defined, then all Stokes vector (1,0,0,0), (1,1,0,0) (1,0,1,0) and (1,0,0,1) 
# are calculated. If undefined, you need to define Io, Qo, Uo, and Vo with outputFilename
