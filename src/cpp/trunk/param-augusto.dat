# Object geometry
#
# The object type.  Currently, we support: box, sphere, single layer
# cylinder and generic.  Generic will read generic.xml (experimental)

# - If the object is a box, one must define:
# xwidth, yheight and zdepth, Nx, Ny and Nz.
# - If the object is a (single) layer, one defines:
# thickness, Nx, Ny and imagingWidth, imagingHeight
# - If the object is a sphere
# the radius is 2 (can't change yet.
# If the object is a cylinder,
# height,radius, Nr, Nh

#Nx=10
#Ny=10
#Nz=10

# For a layer, define the following:
#thickness=0.1
#imagingWidth=1
#imagingHeight=1
#Nx=40
#Ny=40

# For a sphere, define the following, which represent the full width axes
# Currently, a sphere is made from 36 triangular elements
# Each element can be subdivided in Nx * Ny elements for statistics
#size=(1,1,1)
#Nx=1
#Ny=1
#Nz=1

# Number of bins for storing the output photons
# Photons are binned in "acceptanceCosElements" bins
# of width (1 - 0)/acceptanceCosElements
#acceptanceCosElements=10


#
# World geometry
#
# The "world" is responsible for keeping track of energy deposition
# in a Cartesian grid that span from Vol_XMin to Vol_XMax in the x direction,
# Vol_YMin to Vol_YMax in the y direction, Vol_ZMin to Vol_ZMax in the z direction
# Every axis is binned with Nx(yz) elements.
